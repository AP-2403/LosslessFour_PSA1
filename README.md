# 🌍 model_exim — Swipe to Export

An AI-powered B2B matchmaking engine that connects Indian exporters with global buyers using ML-based intent scoring, risk-adjusted news signals, and smart similarity matching.

---

## 📌 What It Does

- Takes an exporter's profile (industry, capacity, certifications, target markets, etc.)
- Scores them against thousands of global buyers
- Adjusts matches using real-time news risk signals (tariffs, wars, calamities, currency shifts)
- Ranks buyers by ML-predicted match score
- Returns a ranked list of best-fit buyers with match labels (Excellent / Good / Fair / Weak)

## ⚙️ Setup

### 1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourname/model_exim.git
cd model_exim
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set up environment variables
Copy the example file and fill in your Supabase credentials:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

```env
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
SUPABASE_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

---

## 🧠 Train the Models

Before running matches, you need to train the intent and match models:

```bash
python ml/train.py
```

This saves `intent_model.pkl` and `match_model.pkl` to `ml/saved/`.

---

## 🚀 Run a Match

### Demo mode (no Supabase needed)
```bash
python ml/match_for_user.py --demo
```
Generates a random mock exporter and matches them against all buyers.

### Real user from Supabase
```bash
python ml/match_for_user.py --user_id "your-supabase-uuid"
```

### Custom options
```bash
python ml/match_for_user.py --demo \
  --buyers data/Importer_LiveSignals_v5_Updated.csv \
  --news data/Global_News_LiveSignals_Updated.csv \
  --output my_matches.csv
```

Output is saved as a CSV ranked by `Match_Score` descending.

## 📊 Scoring Model

### Exporter Score (0–100)
| Component | Weight |
|---|---|
| Reliability (payment terms, response speed, certifications) | 30% |
| Capacity (manufacturing, revenue, team, shipments) | 25% |
| Intent (intent index, hiring, LinkedIn, SalesNav signals) | 25% |
| Risk — inverted (tariff, war, calamity, stock impact) | 20% |

### Buyer Score (0–100)
| Component | Weight |
|---|---|
| Creditworthiness (payment history, funding, revenue) | 30% |
| Intent (intent index, hiring growth) | 25% |
| Engagement (spike, profile visits, DM change) | 20% |
| Response (probability + prompt response speed) | 15% |
| Risk — inverted (tariff, war, calamity, stock) | 10% |

### Match Score (0–100)
```
base_similarity  = 55% cosine + 45% euclidean (on normalised feature vectors)
industry_bonus   = 0 if same industry, -30 if different
capacity_align   = how well exporter capacity meets buyer order size
news_delta       = ±macro risk adjustment from recent news [-20, +10]
engagement_bonus = funding (3pt) + DM change (2.5pt) + spike (2pt) + hiring (1.5pt)
cert_match       = +5 if both sides share the same certification
```

### Match Labels
| Score | Label |
|---|---|
| ≥ 90 | Excellent |
| ≥ 75 | Good |
| ≥ 60 | Fair |
| < 60 | Weak |
